# Music E-Commerce Platform Transformation

This project involves migrating a music e-commerce platform from WordPress to Shopify using modern web technologies like Next.js and the Shopify API. Shopify provides a robust backend for managing products, orders, and payments, significantly improving the platform's performance and user experience.

## Project Overview

We implemented the following steps in the migration process:

1. **Fetch Data from WordPress**: Use WordPress API to fetch all product and category data.
2. **Normalize Data**: Ensure that the WordPress data structure is compatible with Shopify's data model.
3. **Create Shopify Entries**: Use Shopify Admin API to create products, categories, and collections.
4. **API Layer**: Build custom API routes in Next.js to handle the data transfer between WordPress and Shopify.
5. **Frontend Development**: Create components to display products and categories in a clean and user-friendly interface.
